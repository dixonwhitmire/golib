# golib

A collection of handy and useful "library functions" for Go Applications.

Documentation, tests and the implementation will be "locked in" with version 1.0.0.

In the near-term changes will likely be breaking until 1.0.0 is released.

## install
```shell
go get github.com/dixonwhitmire/golib@v0.5.0
